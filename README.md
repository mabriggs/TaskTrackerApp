# TaskTrackerApp

This is a basic task list with login functionality.

See it in action [here](https://tasktrackerapp-production.up.railway.app/).

It allows you to maintain a list of tasks, whereby each task has a name, simple status, and due date.

The UI is (I hope) simple and intuitive. It's not perfect, and probably won't handle large task names very well, but for the purposes of this demo it should suffice.
