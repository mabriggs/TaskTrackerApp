# TaskTrackerApp

This is a basic task list with login functionality.

It allows you to maintain a list of tasks, whereby each task has a name, a simple status, and a due date.

I've concentrated most on the UI, which I hope is simple yet intuitive. It's not perfect, of course, and probably won't handle large task names very well, but for the purposes of this demo it should suffice.
